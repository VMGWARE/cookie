> The spiritual successor to [Camphouse V1](https://git.vmgware.dev/vmgware/camphouse-v1) and a hard fork of [Discuit](https://github.com/discuitnet/discuit/)

This is the codebase that powers [Camphouse](https://camphouse.org), which is an open-source community platform, an alternative to Reddit.

Built with:

- [Go](https://go.dev): The backend.
- [React](https://react.dev/): The frontend.
- [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB): The main datastore.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): For transient data.
- [Meilisearch](https://meilisearch.com/): For searching and indexing.
